# OCR Service Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ Fallback Mode Active

The OCR functionality is currently running in fallback mode due to Tesseract.js worker configuration issues in the Next.js server environment.

## What's Happening

1. **Primary OCR**: Tesseract.js tries to process your uploaded images
2. **Fallback Mode**: If OCR fails, demo text is provided to demonstrate the workflow
3. **All Other Features Work**: Text simplification, text-to-speech, and PDF conversion are fully functional

## Temporary Solution

The application now provides demo text when OCR encounters issues, allowing you to:
- ✅ Test text simplification with OpenAI
- ✅ Test text-to-speech functionality  
- ✅ Test PDF conversion
- ✅ Experience the full dyslexic-friendly interface

## Demo Text Content

The fallback provides educational content about reading benefits, demonstrating:
- Text structure and formatting
- List formatting
- Paragraph organization
- Length suitable for testing all features

## For Production Use

To resolve OCR completely, consider these alternatives:

### Option 1: Client-Side OCR
Move Tesseract.js to run in the browser instead of server:
- Better worker support in browser environment
- No server-side configuration issues
- User's device handles processing

### Option 2: External OCR Service
Use cloud-based OCR services:
- Google Cloud Vision API
- Azure Computer Vision
- AWS Textract
- More reliable and faster processing

### Option 3: Server Configuration
- Configure Tesseract.js for your specific Node.js environment
- Set up proper worker paths for your server
- Handle server-side worker initialization

## Current Workflow

1. **Upload Image** → ✅ Works
2. **OCR Processing** → ⚠️ Fallback to demo text
3. **Text Simplification** → ✅ Works with OpenAI
4. **Text-to-Speech** → ✅ Works perfectly
5. **PDF Conversion** → ✅ Works perfectly

## Testing Instructions

1. Upload any image to see the workflow
2. The app will show demo text instead of extracted text
3. Click "Make This Easier to Read" to test OpenAI simplification
4. Use text-to-speech to hear the simplified text
5. Download the uploaded image as PDF

All features except real OCR are fully functional!
