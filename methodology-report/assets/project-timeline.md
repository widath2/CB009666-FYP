## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Activities
1. **Data Collection (Weeks 4-6)**: Foundation for all ML development
2. **ML Model Development (Weeks 21-25)**: Core functionality delivery
3. **System Integration (Week 30)**: Critical for end-to-end functionality
4. **Expert Validation (Weeks 36-37)**: Required for academic acceptance

### Risk Mitigation Timeline
- **Buffer Time**: 2 weeks built into each major phase
- **Parallel Development**: Non-dependent tasks scheduled concurrently
- **Early Testing**: Continuous testing throughout development phases
- **Stakeholder Reviews**: Regular checkpoints every 4 weeks
