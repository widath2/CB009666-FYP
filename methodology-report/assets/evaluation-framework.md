# Evaluation Framework and Metrics

## Comprehensive Evaluation Methodology

### Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Approach

The evaluation framework employs a **hierarchical assessment structure** that validates the system across multiple dimensions:

```

├── Domain-Specific Performance  
│   ├── Archaeological Validity
│   ├── Linguistic Accuracy
│   └── Historical Context
└── User Experience Performance
    ├── Usability Metrics
    ├── Accessibility Measures
    └── Satisfaction Scores
```
