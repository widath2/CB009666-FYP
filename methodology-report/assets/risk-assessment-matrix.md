## Risk Monitoring and Control Framework

### Risk Assessment Scale

#### Probability Scale
- **Very Low (0.1)**: Less than 10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (0.3)**: 10-30% chance of occurrence  
- **Medium (0.5)**: 30-70% chance of occurrence
- **High (0.7)**: 70-90% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (0.9)**: Greater than 90% chance of occurrence

#### Impact Scale
- **Very Low (0.2)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (0.4)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (0.6)**: Moderate impact, requires management attention
- **High (0.8)**: Significant impact, major management effort required
- **Critical (1.0)**: Severe impact, project success at risk

### Risk Response Strategies

| Risk Level | Risk Score Range | Response Strategy | Management Approach |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 0.64 - 1.00 | Immediate action required | Daily monitoring, Executive involvement |
